## Identity Theft

Identity Theft & Fraud Key Statistics (2023)

* Almost one-third of Americans have been a victim of identity theft.

* Over 300,000 Americans fall victim to phishing/vishing/smishing attacks yearly.

* Every year there are more than 50,000 individual personal data breaches in the US.

Typical methods used to gain access to personal information:

* Phishing

* Hacking or spyware

* Unauthorized access to data

* Discarded information

* Social engineering

## Cyber Stalking/Bullying

* Cyber-stalking or bullying: use of the Internet, e-mail, or other electronic communications devices to stalk or bully another person.

How do you determine whether or not to take a threat seriously? Look for four factors:

* Credibility

* Frequency

* Specificity

* Intensity

## Fraud

Fraud is a broad category of crime that can encompass many different activities. A few of the more common internet-based frauds are:

* Investment Offers - ‘Pump and dump’ securities fraud

* Auction Fraud

* Check/Money Order Fraud

* Data piracy

DOS Attacks

Denial of Service Attacks

* A denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an effort directed at a machine or network to make it unavailable to users.

* Estimated costs to online commerce average more than $1 million per attack.

## Cyberextortion

* It is often performed by obtaining sensitive information and threatening to release it unless a form of payment is received.

* A common tactic is to obtain nude images of a victim and threaten to release them. This version is called “sextortion”

## Cybervandalism

* The process of gaining unauthorized access to a computer system such as a website host and replacing or defacing content

## Cyberprostitution

* Sexual services offered through the Internet.

* FOSTA/SESTA Acts passed in 2018

   * Complex issue because crimes don’t go away, just become less safe for the people involved.

   * Has limited law enforcement ability to track sexual crimes and gather statistical information.

   * Has had a chilling effect on all sexual content online including sexual education and alternative sexuality information.

## The History of Computer Crime

### The pre-history (before 1980)
   
   * Limited crime due to limited computer access

   * Packet switching was described by Leonard Kleinrock at MIT and was published in 1961

   * The Internet began as ARPANet

      * Advanced Research Projects Agency, DoD

      * Research on developing resilient communications networks

      * In 1969 the network consisted of four nodes: the University of Utah, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the University of California at Los Angeles, and Stanford University.

      * In 1981, this network had grown to only 213 nodes
   
   * Phone hacking started in the early 1970s
      * John Draper, former U.S. Air Force engineer, used a whistle that generated specific tones (2600 hz) to place free phone calls.

      * Draper was known as ‘Captain Crunch’. He was repeatedly arrested throughout the 1970s on charges of phone tampering.

         * First known ‘phone phreak’

         * Influenced 2600: The Hacker Quarterly
