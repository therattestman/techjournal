## What is Security?

### Textbook Definition:

Security is protecting what you or others have. This same idea applies to entities like government departments, agencies, companies, institutes, and so on, irrespective of their size or function.

The security of not only physical assets but of non-physical assets as well are important and necessary. Some of these non-physical assets include confidential information and data; intellectual property; research data with the potential of high-value realization and high investment; and the security of your customers or end users when at your facility or while using your systems. The security of the installations with high defense or strategic value, like nuclear installations, nuclear sources, chemical and biological laboratories, and areas with high-level political and administrative dignitaries, are of significance.

### In Simple Terms:

Knowledge, techniques, tools, methods, and persistence to protect the stuff you and/or others place value upon based on risk, priority, and means.

## Scenario

### What are the security concerns if someone finds/steals/borrows your ID card?

* Gains access to areas they shouldn’t
   * May gain information about you they should not have.
* Makes purchases
* You can’t get access to what you need or make purchases

### How could the system be improved so that even if someone has your ID card, they can’t use it effectively?

* Multiple-factor authentication
* Password, fingerprint, PIN

### Why isn’t such a system in place?

* Expensive
* Time-consuming

## The Economics of Security

Security costs money but does not generate profit.

Some examples -
* Equipment: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection/Prevention devices
* Slows down processing: passwords, authentication, just the process of constantly “being secure”
* Personnel : production time + expertise, training

## Can You “Not Care” About Security?

Um ... no!
* Certainly not in this discipline!

What are the risks?
* Identity theft
* Money
* Intellectual property - someone gets access to your paper and submits it as their own
* Data integrity: Somebody changes your information
* Email
* Security cameras


## Security: Day-To-Day Life

Airport TSA: non-existent before 2001

Shopping online started ~ 1995

## Security Factors

What is the primary factor in “weak security”?

Yep, it’s us humans!
* Passwords: Weak, same, or none!
* Training: Do we even know what ‘secure’ is & how to get there?
* Behavior: Internal & External threats

## How is Security Implemented?

Some examples of ways to secure:
* Rooms, buildings: locks, alarms, fences, guards, mean dogs
* Data on a computer: firewall, anti-virus, encryption, login/password
* Update your devices!
* Data traveling on a network: firewall, encryption
* $ transactions: authentication, encryption

## Two Major Approaches

Things to live by...

1. Limit access to only those who need it

2. Transform data so it is only readable to those who need it.

## Defense-In-Depth

Just like modern life... Information Systems (ISs) have become increasingly complex, comprised of multiple components/protocols operating at multiple layers/levels of technology.

Security has become increasingly complex as vulnerabilities have been discovered for all layers of an Information System

Thus, all layers/devices/communications need to be secured.

## Evolution of Computer and Info Security

1950s-60s: Physical Security, & protect the mainframe

Mid-1960s: Multi-User timesharing systems developed. Multiple users share the same hardware and OS. Protection was put in so that data was only seen by the right user

1969: [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET)/Internet

1973: [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) written in C with TCP/IP included
* Provided user authentication (login/password)
* Different levels of access
* Restrictions at the file level

### Networks - PCs

Mid-70s – 80s: PCs/LANs, WANS: mostly proprietary except Internet

Until mid-1990’s: EDU campuses only had a few machines connected to the Internet
* People used command-line programs (read: no GUI!) over slow serial connections or phone modems to email

Viruses were starting to be an issue but were transported on [floppy disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk) rather than network

### World Wide Web (WWW)

Early 1990s: [WWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) developed!

Mid-late 90s: [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) available. Now each desktop could access the Internet.
* This makes each computer a security threat vector!

This was a phenomenon similar to what we have today with [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) and personal devices expanding the Internet and vulnerable surfaces

## Information Security

Information security is meant to protect information and information systems from unauthorized users accessing, using, modifying, or destroying the information.

## Tools, Standards, Guidelines

Various tools are developed daily to combat the compromise of information security.

Several standards and guidelines have been implemented to reduce the propensity for information security breaches.

## What does Security Include?

Information security also spans aspects like hardware and infrastructure, the operating system, networks, applications, software systems, utilities, and tools

Other important contributors (favorable or adverse) to the field of information security are human beings, particularly employees, contractors, system providers, and hackers*.

## Information Security Today

Information is anything that is communicated in any form.

Any compromise of information can significantly impact the parties involved, including the loss of reputation, finances, or other consequences.

Pro Tip: All forms of technology are under attack.
